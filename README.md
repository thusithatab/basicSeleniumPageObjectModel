# basicSeleniumPageObjectModel
In this project I have created a very basic Page Object Model Framework. This is a java project which uses selenium jar files and chrome web driver. Functionality wise, this opens a new google chrome window and then type a text in the search box and closes the browser. In addition I have used Page Factory Method to initialize elements.
